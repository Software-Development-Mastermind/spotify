# Summary

This application utilizes Spotify's API to fetch artists, albums, or songs. Users can go to the search page and choose from the dropdown menu options to tailor your search. Additionally, by clicking on an artist's profile on the random page, users are able to generate a random song from any of the 5 artists.

This application is purely frontend and authenticates directly to Spotify's API via API keys.

I had a lot of fun building this application and making it user friendly and Spotify themed. I wanted to challenge myself by making this purely frontend since my last project (Twitter clone) I built out a backend server to handle API requests and various tasks.

Stay tuned for added features in the near future!
